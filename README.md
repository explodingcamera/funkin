# FnKit

Get the serverless experience without the vendor lock-in.
With FnKit, you have the same fast development experience like with other FaaS frameworks but can run your code anywhere.

Deploy your app to production with one command:

```
$ fnkit dev    # start dev server
$ fnkit test   # run tests
$ fnkit build  # build a docker container
```
