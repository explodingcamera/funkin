# funkin' (Work in Progress)

Get the serverless experience without the vendor lock-in.
With funkin', you have the same fast development experience FaaS frameworks provide but can run your code anywhere with next to no setup.

Deploy your app to production with one command:

```
$ fnkit dev    # start dev server
$ fnkit test   # run tests
$ fnkit build  # build a docker container
```
